                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Andrew and I am currently enrolled with the coding bootcamp at UC Davis. A few reasons that drove me to do software engineering is my visual impairment, love for tech, blockchain, and web3. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Some of my hobbies I have outside of this work space are family time with my wife and son, crypto, MMA, being a Celiac Disease Foundation Ambassador, selling Real Estate, and a few moments of relaxation. 
                    </p>
